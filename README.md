# SIMD Programming Project
This is an implementation of a dot product kernel using four different approaches:
1. C Program â€“ A standard implementation in C.
2. x86-64 Assembly Language 
3. x86 SIMD AVX2 (XMM Registers) 
4. x86 SIMD AVX2 (YMM Registers) 

The kernel computes the dot product of two vectors, A and B, both represented as double-precision floating-point arrays. The operation follows the formula:

### Input
- n: An integer representing the length of vectors A and B.
-  A, B: Vectors containing double-precision floating-point values.

### Output
- Store the computed sdot value in memory.
- Display the result on the console for all implementations.

## Execution Time Table
### 1. Average Execution Time
The following tables contains the average execution time (in microseconds) for different implementations  measured in both Debug and Release modes across various vector sizes.
